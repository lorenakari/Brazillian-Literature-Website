# Brazillian Literature Website

I created this for the SheCodes workshop final project.
It's a simple webpage about Brazillian Literature with a small text talking about it and a list of important Brazillian books.
In the bottom of the page there is a button that says "Original Titles" so that the user can see the original titles of the books in portuguese.
